       "\"Declaration of IndependenceIN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776. The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the\\npolitical bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the\\nearth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle\\n\\nthem, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes\\n\\nwhich impel them to the separation. \\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by\\n\\ntheir Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit\\nof Happiness.ŠThat to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving\\n\\ntheir just powers from the consent of the governed,ŠThat whenever any Form of Government\\nbecomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to\\ninstitute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in\\nsuch form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence,\\n\\nindeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and\\ntransient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to\\nsuffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they\\n\\nare accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same\\nObject evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,\\nto throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.ŠSuch has\\nbeen the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains\\n\\nthem to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great\\n\\nBritain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the\\nestablishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a\\ncandid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the\\npublic good.\\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing\\nimportance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained;\\nand when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\\n\\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of\\npeople, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the\\nLegislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. \\n\\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant\\nfrom the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into\\ncompliance with his measures.\\n\""

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms:Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character isthus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them fromtime to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. Wehave reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We haveappealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of ourcommon kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt ourconnections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and ofconsanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation,and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress,Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do,in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish anddeclare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States;that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection', 'between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free\\n\\nand Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances,\\nestablish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right\\n\\ndo. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine\\nProvidence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.\\n\\n[The 56 signatures on the Declaration were arranged in six columns:\\n] [Column 1]\\n Georgia:   Button Gwinnett\\n   Lyman \\nHall   George Walton \\n[Column 2]\\n North Carolina:   William Hooper\\n   Joseph Hewes\\n   John Penn\\n South Carolina:   Edward Ru\\ntledge   Thomas Heyward, Jr.\\n  Thomas Lynch, Jr.\\n  Arthur Middleton \\n[Column 3]\\n Massachusetts:   John Hancock\\n\\n Maryland:   Samuel Chase\\n\\n   William Paca\\n\\n   Thomas Stone\\n\\n   Charles Carroll of Carrollton\\n\\n Virginia:   George Wythe\\n\\n   Richard Henry Lee\\n\\n   Thomas Jefferson\\n\\n   Benjamin Harrison\\n\\n   Thomas Nelson, Jr.\\n\\n   Francis Lightfoot Lee\\n\\n   Carter Braxton \\n\\n[Column 4]\\n Pennsylvania:  Robert Morris\\n\\n   Benjamin Rush\\n   Benjamin Fran\\nklin   John Morton\\n', '   George Clymer\\n   James Smith\\n   George Taylor\\n   James Wilson\\n   George Ross\\n Delaware:   Caesar Rodney\\n   George Read\\n   Thomas McKean \\n[Column 5]\\n New York:   Wi\\nlliam Floyd   Philip Livingston\\n   Francis L\\newis   Lewis Morris\\n New Jersey:   Richard Stockton\\n   John Witherspoon\\n   Francis Hopkinson\\n   John Hart\\n   Abraham Clark \\n[Column 6]\\n New Hampshire:   Josiah Bartlett\\n   William Whipple\\n Massachusetts:   Samuel Adams\\n   John Adams\\n   Robert Treat Paine\\n   Elbridge Gerry\\n Rhode Island:   Stephen Hopkins\\n   William Ellery\\n Connecticut:   Roger Sherman\\n   Samuel Huntington\\n   William Williams\\n   Oliver Wolcott\\n New Hampshire: Matthew Thornton\\n ']\n"
